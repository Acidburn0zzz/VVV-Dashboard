* Lots of changes, refactoring both actions and hosts
* New hosts objects allows separating different types of hosts and hopefully fixes all past issues related to hosts
* New commands/action objects handles all of the theme, plugins, backups, etc...
* Added branch specific version check so if you are running a branch other than mater you will get a notice for updates in that branch.
* Folders in the {VVV}/www/ directory that start with a _ underscore are tracked and marked as archives in the dashboard so you can archive sites in a directory like _archives
* Live search in backups
